# = Health Monitor 
# Monitor individual aspects of your rails application's health
#
# Most rails applications have many additional moving parts of which the health cannot be assessed with 
# simply pinging the (hopefully page cached) homepage 
#
# For example, 
# * Is Email is sent successfully?
# * Is the SMS gateway alive and you bought sufficient credits?
# * All database connections are alive? Backgroundrb down again?
# * The cloud computing setup jacked the imagemagick? Again?
# * You are running out of disk space and there are no more file descriptors for your
# * The git SHA and version is what ?
#
# Health Monitor adds a single controller action to generate an html, js, or xml report with details of *all* 
# your custom defined health checks. An error response code (500 server error) indicates failure
# when any monitored feature fails or exceeds the custom timeout definition. Health monitor is easier to setup than
# custom server side cron tasks and adds the advantage of exercising more code since everything from your load balancer 
# to nginx to mongrels must be happily shoving rubies around to get that 200 oh boy success message.
# So ping away, grab a beer and know that hey, you might be too drunk but at least you will know your application 
# is sick before your clients do.
# 
# ====Examples
#
# class HealthMonitorController < ApplicationController
#   acts_as_health_monitor
#
#   # montior the database connection
#   monitor_health :database, :description => 'Check database connection'
#
#   # Monitor email sending. Fail if it exceeds 4 minutes
#   monitor_health :email,
#     :timeout => 240000 # Fail this test if it exceeds 4 minutes
#     :method => lambda{ |controller|  ActionMailer::Base.deliver_my_mail('blah') }
#
#   # Display the results of system df call with the results
#   monitor_health :check_disk, :description => 'Check Disk status' do |controller|
#     results = `df`
#     status = $? == 0 ? :success : :failure
#     { :status => status, :message => "DF: #{results}" }
#   end
#
#   protected
#   def database; ActiveRecord::Base.connection; end
#
# end
#
# === +monitor_health+ Options
# <tt>:description</tt> - description of the task
# <tt>:message</tt> - Defaults to SUCCESS or FAILED!
#   Additional information that is either a string or a hash with keys <tt>:success</tt> and <tt>:failure</tt>
#   Message allows more custom result information, such as the number of servers queried or IP address
#   or git version.
#
# <tt>:timeout</tt> - Fails the health check if the total time exceeds <tt>:timeout</tt> milliseconds
# <tt>:method</tt> - The name of the method or a Proc to invoke. A block can be given as well.
# Defaults to the method with the feature name
#
# === Monitored Methods
# The proc or method defined should return its status as one of the following:
# * true or false indicating success or failure
#   monitor_health :mymonitor, :method => { |controller| ...do something ... ; true }
#
#   monitor_health :myothermonitor
#   def myothermonitor; false; end
#
# * a status symbol: of <tt>:success</tt>, <tt>:failure</tt>, <tt>:timeout</tt>, <tt>:skipped</tt>
#   monitor_health :mymonitor, :method => { |controller| ...do something ... ; :failure }
#
# * a hash of attributes including:
# ** <tt>:status</tt> must be a value listed above: defaults to failure
# ** <tt>:message</tt> Custom message with result data
# ** <tt>:description</tt> The task description
#
#   monitor_health :mymonitor do |controller|
#     ...do something ... ;
#     { :status => :success, :message => 'My custom results for server abc', :description => 'task description' }
#   end
#
# === Routes
# By default, the route resources are added (assume controller is named +HealthMonitorController+)
# The action defined is named +monitor_health+
#
# Base resource if show is not already defined by +health_monitor_url+
#   host/health_monitor.js?skip=mysql
#
# Member accessor +monitor_health_health_monitor+
#   host/health_monitor/monitor_health.js?only=thatone,thisone
#
# To disable and write your own routes, use +route+ option with +acts_as_health_monitor+
#   acts_as_health_monitor :route => false
